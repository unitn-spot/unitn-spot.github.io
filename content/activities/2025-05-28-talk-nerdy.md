We are excited to announce that the SPIE Student Chapter is organizing a special event to connect PhD students and Master’s students through short, engaging research presentations!

📅 Event Title: "Talk Nerdy to Me: PhD Speed-Dating"  
🎯 Audience: Master’s students from across the department  
📍 Purpose: Share your research, inspire future researchers, and build connections  
🕔 Format: 4-minute presentations + 1-minute Q&A  
📅 Date & Time: Wednesday 28th May from 17 to 19 + aperitif  
📍 Location: atrium Povo2  
💻 Equipment:  everyone is encouraged to prepare a short presentation and bring his/her own laptop for an easier interaction with the audience  

We’re inviting PhD students to give a brief, accessible talk about their research. The goal is to give Master’s students a glimpse into the breadth of work happening in our department, get them to know the possibilities offered by a Ph.D. course, and possibly help them explore possible paths for their own research or thesis work. We suggest that you discuss with your supervisor whether you have open thesis projects that may be of interest to master's students, and, if so, present them during the event. Notice that the presentation of a possible thesis project is not mandatory, and you can join the event even if your group does not sponsor any thesis project at this moment. The main focus remains on presenting your research activity!

This is a great opportunity to:
- Practice communicating your work to a broader audience
- Inspire the next generation of researchers
- Build visibility and spark potential collaborations
