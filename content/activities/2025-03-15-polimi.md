This week we spent a day at the Politecnico di Milano with a representative of the local student chapter affiliated to SPIE, Optica, and EPS. 💡🌈

The visit was a good occasion for exchanging good practices between chapters, enforcing the networking and planning future meetings and events. 
Sooooo.... stay tuned 🔥⏰️
