Welcome to the website of the Students of Photonics - unitn!

We are a group of passionate Bachelor, Master and PhD students from University of Trento and Fondazione Bruno Kessler, interested in Optics and Photonics. 
We gather in this student group (or chapter) to discuss scientific and technological research and to organize events and activities.

## What is photonics?

Photonics is the name used nowadays to refer to the discipline related to the generation, manipulation and detections of light (and hence, photons). 
It is common to refer also to Optics & Photonics.
On top of this, it interlaces with many other fields, such as solid-state and semiconductor physics, nanofabrication, and information technology.
So Lasers, photodiodes, Detectors, Amplifiers, quantum fluids of light, electro-optical modulators, quantum optical computingâ€¦ all fall under these umbrellas.

As the miniaturization level increases, photonics continues to acquire importance and give birth to fantastic research.
